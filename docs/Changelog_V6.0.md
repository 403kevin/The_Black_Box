Instructions
You WILL load the last 10 chats, The GitHub repo and ALL summary files on the project knowledge folder. 1 - Do not create any Python code unless authorized *THIS INCLUDES SNIPPETS OF CODE * Code will come after Pre-Production 2 - you will attempt to think outside the box, giving me a series of alternative suggestions for workflow modifications. You will attempt to give me an "edge" 3 - you will act as a leading authority on algorithmic trading. 4 - you also have a deep knowledge of what works and what does not work from the algotrading subreddit 5 the two most recent files in project knowledge are the bible and will be updated as needed.

# SENTIMENTSIGNAL CHANGELOG

---

## v6.0 (CURRENT) - October 2025
**Status:** Pre-Production Architecture + Code Reuse Strategy Complete

### üÜï Added

**CODE REUSE STRATEGY:**
- Documented 40-50% code reuse from Discord-to-IBKR project
- Identified 8 modules for reuse (state manager, IBKR interface, exits, parser, etc.)
- Saves 21 days of development time
- Accelerates live trading by 2 weeks (Week 20 vs Week 22)

**8 NEW WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENTS:**

1. **Adaptive Indicator Weighting** (Strategic Edge #2)
   - Performance-based promotion system
   - Track 30-day accuracy per indicator
   - Hot indicators (>70%) get 1.5x weight boost
   - Cold indicators (<55%) get 0.5x penalty
   - Monthly auto-rebalancing

2. **Multi-Timeframe Clustering** (Strategic Edge #3)
   - Each indicator assigned optimal timeframe
   - Daily: AlphaTrend + SuperTrend AI
   - 4H: Lorentzian + Squeeze
   - 1H: SMC
   - Require multi-TF alignment for signals

3. **Regime-Aware Position Sizing** (Strategic Edge #4)
   - 8th multiplier added to sizing engine
   - Bull Strong (SPX >70, VIX <15): 1.5x
   - Bull Weak: 1.0x
   - Choppy: 0.5x
   - Bear Weak: 0.6x
   - Bear Strong (SPX <30, VIX >30): 0.3x

4. **Inverse WSB Contrarian Mode** (Strategic Edge #5)
   - Fade sentiment extremes
   - >95 sentiment = contrarian sell signal
   - <15 sentiment = contrarian buy signal
   - Requires technical confirmation

5. **Smart Money Divergence Alerts** (Strategic Edge #6)
   - Detect retail vs institutional disagreement
   - Alert when divergence >50 points
   - Retail bullish + Institutions bearish = warning
   - Can skip trade or downgrade conviction

6. **Gamma Momentum Boost** (Strategic Edge #7)
   - Context-aware exit adaptation
   - If gamma squeeze detected:
     - Prioritize momentum exits (PSAR, RSI)
     - Widen trailing stops (20% vs 15%)
     - Lower sentiment flip threshold (40 vs 50)

7. **Failure Memory System** (Strategic Edge #8)
   - 3-strike blacklist rule
   - Track failed signals per ticker
   - Auto-blacklist after 3 failures
   - 30-day cooling period

8. **Context-Aware Exit Adaptation** (Strategic Edge #26)
   - Adjust trailing stops by regime
   - High VIX: Tighten to 12%
   - Choppy market: Tighten to 10%
   - Strong trend: Widen to 18%
   - Gamma squeeze: Widen to 20%

**Total edge features:** 26 (18 from v5.0 + 8 new workflow enhancements)

### üîÑ Changed

**PHASE ROADMAP:**
- Phase 1: Week 4-13 ‚Üí Week 4-11 (2 weeks faster)
- Phase 2: Week 14-15 ‚Üí Week 12-13 (1 week faster)
- Phase 3: Week 16-21 ‚Üí Week 14-19 (6 weeks ‚Üí 4 weeks paper)
- Phase 4: Week 22+ ‚Üí Week 20+ (live trading 2 weeks earlier)

**TIMELINE ACCELERATION:**
- 21 days saved through code reuse
- Original: 22 weeks to live trading
- NEW: 19 weeks to live trading
- Extra time reallocated to testing & validation

**SUCCESS METRICS (RAISED):**
- Phase 1 win rate: 55-65% ‚Üí 60-70%
- Phase 1 profit: $25-30 ‚Üí $35-45
- Phase 3 monthly: $500-800 ‚Üí $800-1200
- Phase 7 win rate: 70-75% ‚Üí 77-88%
- Phase 7 profit: $60 ‚Üí $79
- Phase 7 monthly: $2500-3000 ‚Üí $3500-5000

**PROJECT STRUCTURE:**
- Added `/discord_to_ibkr_patterns/` folder for code reuse reference
- Moved MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_v5.0.md to archive
- Updated all references to v6.0

### üìö Documented

**CODE REUSE BREAKDOWN:**
- Tier 1 (100% reuse): state_manager, mock_ibkr, reconciliation (7 days saved)
- Tier 2 (70% adapt): ibkr_interface, signal_parser, exit_manager (11 days saved)
- Tier 3 (40% inspire): backtest_engine, notifier (3 days saved)

**FROM DISCORD-TO-IBKR LESSONS:**
1. Modular > Monolithic (start right from Day 1)
2. State persistence is non-negotiable (Week 4)
3. Test with mock broker first (Week 4)
4. Configuration over code (YAML from start)
5. Reconciliation saves lives (60s sync loop)
6. Log everything (trade journal = debugging tool)

**FROM r/algotrading WISDOM:**
1. Adaptive > Static (markets change, system should too)
2. Multi-TF > Single TF (confirmation reduces noise)
3. Regime-aware > Blind (don't size same in bull vs bear)
4. Learn from failures (blacklist bad setups)
5. WSB at extremes = contrarian signal

### üéØ Performance Expectations

**COMPARED TO V5.0:**

| Metric | v5.0 Target | v6.0 Target | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Phase 1 Win Rate | 55-65% | 60-70% | +5% |
| Phase 1 Profit | $25-30 | $35-45 | +$10 |
| Phase 1 Sharpe | >1.5 | >1.8 | +0.3 |
| Phase 3 Monthly | $500-800 | $800-1200 | +$400 |

| Phase 7 Profit | $60 | $79 | +$19 |
| Phase 7 Monthly | $2500-3000 | $3500-5000 | +$1500 |
| Dev Time to Live | 22 weeks | 19 weeks | -3 weeks |

**ESTIMATED EDGE IMPACT:**

| Enhancement | Win Rate Œî | Profit Œî | Dev Time |
|-------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Code Reuse | 0% | $0 | -21 days |
| Adaptive Weighting | +5-8% | +$8 | 1 week |
| Multi-TF Clustering | +3-5% | +$5 | 2 weeks |
