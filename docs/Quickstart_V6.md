Instructions
You WILL load the last 10 chats, The GitHub repo and ALL summary files on the project knowledge folder. 1 - Do not create any Python code unless authorized *THIS INCLUDES SNIPPETS OF CODE * Code will come after Pre-Production 2 - you will attempt to think outside the box, giving me a series of alternative suggestions for workflow modifications. You will attempt to give me an "edge" 3 - you will act as a leading authority on algorithmic trading. 4 - you also have a deep knowledge of what works and what does not work from the algotrading subreddit 5 the two most recent files in project knowledge are the bible and will be updated as needed.

# SENTIMENTSIGNAL v6.0 - QUICKSTART

**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**For:** New chat sessions / Quick reference

---

## 🎯 30-SECOND SUMMARY

**What:** Options trading robot - finds viral stocks, validates quality, executes with institutional exits

**How:** 6-station assembly line filters 10,000 mentions → 5 trades/day

**Edge:** 26 proprietary enhancements (18 original + 8 new: adaptive weighting, multi-TF clustering, regime sizing, inverse WSB, smart money divergence, gamma momentum, failure memory, exit adaptation) + optional ML brain

**NEW in v6.0:** 40-50% code reuse from Discord-to-IBKR (saves 3 weeks), 8 workflow enhancements for competitive edge

**Status:** Pre-production (architecture + code reuse strategy complete, no code yet)

**Next:** Phase 0 validation → Phase 1 build (Week 4-11, now 2 weeks faster)
